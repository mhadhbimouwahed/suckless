# Suckless tools

This repo includes all of my [suckless utils](https://suckless.org/), including my DWM build with the themes that I use.

## List of applied patches for `DWM`

## Installing patches

- Download the diff file into the suckless utility folder that you are patching.
- Run :

```sh
patch -p1 < dif_file_name.diff
```

- If you encounter any errors, a new file named will be created, you will need to apply the remaining modifications manually.

- Run `./install.sh`.

## Best practices

- Add dwm.desktop to `/usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop` to be able to launch it from a display manager and check that it is executable.
- For this build to work, make sure you have a `.dwm` folder in your home directory with an `autostart.sh` script.
